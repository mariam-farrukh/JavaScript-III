/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global Binding: When 'this' points to the window in any place. 
    It's like saying 'this house' to a house in a row of houses, 
    where we just don't know which house is being talked about.

* 2. Implicit Binding: It's like saying there is the object, so let's go to it.
    This is when 'this' is replaced by an object. Ex: this.name can be parent.name.

* 3. New Binding: Involves constructor functions creates an object,
    and we call it with 'new'. 
    
* 4. Explicit Binding: Giving a specific object or variable a new context. Something
    that can't be applied to anything else adn you can use methods on that specific
    object or variable
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
